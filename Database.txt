how can i receive a visa through my school$$There are two types of visas for students: F-1 and M-1. You must be enrolled full-time in a language, vocational, or educational program approved by the USCIS. Importantly, you must be able to support yourself and intend to return home after your studies end.
how do i know if i am being detained and what should i do$$Detention means being held for further questioning and that you are required to stay with the officer. Indicators of detention include police tell you that you are not free to leave, police display a weapon, police physically touch you, or police threaten you. You have to stay with the officer until he or she lets you go. Remember to stay calm and not argue. Detention requires "reasonable suspicion" that you have or are about to commit a crime. Also, police may not search you during a detention unless they have probable cause or consent. Here is a sample conversation with phrases you should use: "What is your reasonable suspicion for detaining me?" "I do not consent to this search." "I'm going to remain silent."
